# communicate_with_files
This program is an LLM-based application to chat with files, including PDF and image files, with formats such as PNG, JPG, JPEG, and GIF. It is capable of assisting users by answering a list of questions they can have about the content of the file. 

The openAI embedding model used for this program is text-embedding-ada-002. The application is deployed by using Streamlit. 

To utilize this app, users first need to upload their PDF file or image file (with text content); the file is saved in the application just during the chatting time, and it is then discarded when the user closes the application or uploads another file. 

The program's author, Betel (Betty) Tadesse, maintains and contributes to this project. Contact Information is shown below. Please DM for assistance.
